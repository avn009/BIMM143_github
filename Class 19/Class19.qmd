# 1. Investigating pertussis cases by year

The CDC tracks cases of Pertussis in the UC. We can get their




> Q1. With the help of the R “addin” package datapasta assign the CDC pertussis case number data to a data frame called cdc and use ggplot to make a plot of cases numbers over time.

```{r echo=FALSE}

       )
```


```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
baseplot <- ggplot(cdc) + 
  aes(Year, Cases) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Cases of Pertussis in the US from 1920 to 2019", subtitle = "Data from the CDC")

baseplot
  
```

> Q2. Using the ggplot geom_vline() function add lines to your previous plot for the 1946 introduction of the wP vaccine and the 1996 switch to aP vaccine (see example in the hint below). What do you notice?

```{r}
baseplot + geom_vline(xintercept= 1946, col = "red") + 
  geom_vline(xintercept=1996, col = "blue")
```

We see that the wP vaccine would decrease the amount of cases, but the aP vaccince, though not right away, would eventually increase the amount of cases in the US.


> Q3. Describe what happened after the introduction of the aP vaccine? Do you have a possible explanation for the observed trend?

After the introduction of the aP vaccine, we still saw the case number relatively low for a while but we start to see a little increase of cases. This is because the vaccine may be too weak for the virus, or that it may be a contributor/causation of the virus cases




# The CMI-PB Project

The CMI-PB project is collecting data on aP and nP individuals and their immune response to infection and or booster shots

CMI-PB returns data from its API in JSON format (like most APIs). We will use jsonlite package to get data from 

```{r}
library(jsonlite)
```

```{r}
subject <- read_json("https://www.cmi-pb.org/api/subject", simplifyVector = TRUE)

head(subject)
```


> Q4. How may aP and wP infancy vaccinated subjects are in the dataset?


```{r}
table(subject$infancy_vac)
```
There are 47 aP individuals and 49 wP individuals


> Q5. How many Male and Female subjects/patients are in the dataset?

```{r}
table(subject$biological_sex)
```
There are 66 females and 30 males


> Q6. What is the breakdown of race and biological sex (e.g. number of Asian females, White males etc…)?

```{r}
table(subject$race, subject$biological_sex)
```

```{r}
library(lubridate)
```

```{r}
age_days <- today() - ymd(subject$year_of_birth)
age_years <- time_length(age_days, "years")
subject$age <- age_years
```


> Q7. Using this approach determine (i) the average age of wP individuals, (ii) the average age of aP individuals; and (iii) are they significantly different?

```{r}
mean(subject$age)
```

```{r}
library(dplyr)

ap.age <- filter(subject, infancy_vac == "aP")$age 
wp.age <- filter(subject, infancy_vac == "wP")$age 

mean(ap.age)

mean(wp.age)
```

T-Test
```{r}
t.test(ap.age, wp.age)
```

> Q8. Determine the age of all individuals at time of boost?

```{r}
int <- ymd(subject$date_of_boost) - ymd(subject$year_of_birth)
age_at_boost <- time_length(int, "year")
head(age_at_boost)
```

> Q9. With the help of a faceted boxplot (see below), do you think these two groups are significantly different?

```{r}
ggplot(subject) +
  aes(age,
      fill=as.factor(infancy_vac)) +
  geom_histogram(show.legend=FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(vars(infancy_vac), nrow=2) 
```

# Joining multiple tables

Read the specimen and ab_titer tables into R and store the data as specimen and titer named data frames.

```{r}
specimen <- read_json("https://www.cmi-pb.org/api/specimen", simplifyVector = TRUE)

titer <- read_json("https://www.cmi-pb.org/api/ab_titer", simplifyVector = TRUE)
```

```{r}
head(specimen)
```

```{r}
head(titer)
```

>  Q9. Complete the code to join specimen and subject tables to make a new merged data frame containing all specimen records along with their associated subject details:

```{r}
meta <- inner_join(specimen, subject)
dim(meta)
head(meta)
```

> Q10. Now using the same procedure join meta with titer data so we can further analyze this data in terms of time of visit aP/wP, male/female etc.

```{r}
abdata <- inner_join(titer, meta)
dim(abdata)
```

```{r}
head(abdata)
```


> Q11. How many specimens (i.e. entries in abdata) do we have for each isotype?

```{r}
table(abdata$isotype)
```

We have 6 specimen

> Q12. What do you notice about the number of visit 8 specimens compared to other visits?

```{r}
table(abdata$visit)
```

Visit 8 specimen is much lower compared to the other visit specimen


```{r}
ig1 <- abdata %>% filter(isotype == "IgG1", visit!=8)
head(ig1)
```


> Q13. Complete the following code to make a summary boxplot of Ab titer levels for all antigens:

```{r}
ggplot(ig1) +
  aes(MFI, antigen) +
  geom_boxplot() + 
  facet_wrap(vars(visit), nrow=2)
```

> Q14. What antigens show differences in the level of IgG1 antibody titers recognizing them over time? Why these and not others?

FIM2/3, FHA, PT all are in the aP boost vaccine



```{r}
ggplot(ig1) +
  aes(MFI, antigen, col=infancy_vac ) +
  geom_boxplot(show.legend = FALSE) + 
  facet_wrap(vars(visit), nrow=2) +
  theme_bw()
```

```{r}
ggplot(ig1) +
  aes(MFI, antigen, col=infancy_vac ) +
  geom_boxplot(show.legend = FALSE) + 
  facet_wrap(vars(infancy_vac, visit), nrow=2)
```

> Q15. Filter to pull out only two specific antigens for analysis and create a boxplot for each. You can chose any you like. Below I picked a “control” antigen (“Measles”, that is not in our vaccines) and a clear antigen of interest (“FIM2/3”, extra-cellular fimbriae proteins from B. pertussis that participate in substrate attachment).

```{r}
filter(ig1, antigen=="Measles") %>%
  ggplot() +
  aes(MFI, col=infancy_vac) +
  geom_boxplot(show.legend = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(vars(visit)) +
  theme_bw()
```

```{r}
filter(ig1, antigen=="FIM2/3") %>%
  ggplot() +
  aes(MFI, col=infancy_vac) +
  geom_boxplot(show.legend = TRUE) +
  facet_wrap(vars(visit)) +
  theme_bw()
```

> Q16. What do you notice about these two antigens time course and the FIM2/3 data in particular?

We see that the levels are increasing over time, but aP passes wP levels by day 4

> Q17. Do you see any clear difference in aP vs. wP responses?

You don't see much difference in the beginning, but you start to see a gap between aP and wP over time. You also see that aP passes wP after day 4.



```{r}
rna <- read_json("https://www.cmi-pb.org/api/v2/rnaseq?versioned_ensembl_gene_id=eq.ENSG00000211896.7" , simplifyVector = TRUE) 
```

```{r}
ssrna <- inner_join(rna, meta)
head(ssrna)
```

```{r}
ggplot(ssrna) +
  aes(visit, tpm, group=subject_id) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line(alpha=0.2)
```

> Q19.: What do you notice about the expression of this gene (i.e. when is it at it’s maximum level)?

Expression is at its max level at visit 4

> Q20. Does this pattern in time match the trend of antibody titer data? If not, why not?

No it doesn't since antigens have a long shelf life

```{r}
ggplot(ssrna) +
  aes(tpm, col=infancy_vac) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_wrap(vars(visit))
```

```{r}
ssrna %>%  
  filter(visit==4) %>% 
  ggplot() +
    aes(tpm, col=infancy_vac) + geom_density() + 
    geom_rug() 
```
